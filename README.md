- Streamlit (optional frontend)
- sentence-transformers (embeddings)
- PyMuPDF (PDF parsing)
- FAISS (vector database)

### Features

- Upload one or more PDF files
- Extract and chunk text by paragraph and page
- Generate embeddings for each chunk (locally, free)
- Store embeddings and metadata in FAISS (local, persistent)
- Ask natural language questions about uploaded PDFs
- Retrieve and display answers with source PDF and page number
- Simple web UI (Streamlit) or API endpoints

### How to Run

1. (Recommended) Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Start FastAPI server:
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```
4. (Optional) Start Streamlit UI:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/streamlit_ui.py
   ```
